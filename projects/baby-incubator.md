#### OVERVIEW

A team is developing incubator for rural clinics and hospitals. The prototype of the incubator has been already developed in wooden box and electronic circuits for controlling and monitoring the temperature, humidity and other parameters has been developed. The next step is to design the product for commercial purpose, which will be affordable by rural clinics.

#### PROBLEM

A new-born infant period is the most fragile period of the human life and this period is most susceptible to morbidity and mortality. Neonatal morbidity and Mortality significantly contribute to infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate globally; premature birth is one of the major cause behind neonatal mortality in Nepal.  The neonatal mortality death rate of Nepal per 1000 birth was 23 according of 2013, with premature births contributing to 31% of deaths as the highest number, followed by birth asphyxia and birth trauma (23%), sepsis and other infectious conditions allocates (18%), and congenital abnormalities (13%) as other causes of infant deaths.  Although solutions and technologies exist today to improve the survival and health of preterm babies, a significant group of people in developing countries like Nepal still have no access to these solutions. A neonatal incubator, widely used device for saving infant life during these conditions, is one such example – the health centre’s and hospitals in low resource and rural areas of Nepal often lacks this simple device because of low funds of the health care centre’s and high cost of branded sophisticated incubators, other problems such as low grade device, and inadequate quantities of device also often prevent people from getting access to using baby incubators.

#### POSSIBLE SOLUTION

Our priority is to develop “Low cost baby incubator” for rural areas health post and birth centre. Design a low cost neonatal incubator along with Phototherapy unit in the same device to address the problem of neonatal jaundice. Where 60% of new birth are prone to suffer from neonatal jaundice. A system consists of a mechanism to keep the baby in the incubator warm and provide an artificial environment that mimics the environment of the mother’s womb regarding the temperature, humidity and oxygen supply. The base of the incubator is a composite panel that includes a heater, a fan and a humidifying element. A phototherapy unit consisting of a blue LED light compartment is added on top to address the health needs of jaundiced baby. Therefore, Nani Incubator would be the best solution to treat the babies of rural areas of Nepal. For health centre’s having low resources. Easy to access in local market, easy to handle and low complication on performance. Which is likely to be acceptable by the public and health personal on days to come.

#### METHODOLOGY

Our system is very much inspired by the medical drones developed by Zipline. We intend to design and develop all the parts excluding electronic components within our country. We hope to make a MDP  keeping the cost low and at the same time making an opportunity to keep a sustainable manufacturing unit in our country. The navigation software would be developed in house. This would be the basis for managing the MDP flight deliveries. A logistics unit would be setup to make provisions for all the possible medical supplies in the base health posts. Logistics management software would be developed by the in house  unit as well.
